              <p>Well if I had to ask him ten questions…..well I do have issues as a common man who wants India to prosper so the citizens can enjoy the benefits:

              <p><b>What is the plan for improving the quality of health care in India, particularly in the public health sector??</b></p>
          
          <p>I saw that there was a debate on BBC and Al-Jazeera, regarding the loss of many infants lives in Gorakhpur recently. While some might say these channels always show India in a negative light, that doesn’t act as an excuse to hide the issue. We know that many doctors prefer to work in urban and posh hospitals, and as a result good quality health care isn’t available to many Indians. We should be able to provide quality doctors and hospitals within a 50 km range in my opinion. I hope the government has a plan to do the same.</p>
          
          <p><b>2. When will India adopt a proactive approach to disaster management rather than giving funds in the event of a disaster?</b></p>
          
          <p>There has been a rise in disasters causing loss of lives, especially which could have been avoided with better planning. From Uttarakhand to Assam, with Mumbai and Chennai hit by floods too. We need to ensure all buildings meet the required safety standards. The problem is also that we see many buildings come up in dangerous areas simply because the business men prefer it that way. We also know that hundreds of years old temples survived the Uttarakhand landslides but the new buildings did not. So we need to ensure there is proper planning to avoid such disasters, and also give people places to live in rather than dangerous areas.</p>
          
          <p><b>3. Why do we not add incentives for research and development field?</b></p>
          
          <p>The Indian middle class dream is for a kid to be enrolled in medicine or engineering and get a plum job abroad or something. One thing is our universities do not have the quality of facilities that other top international universities provide. Another problem is fresh research talent is forced into other jobs due to lack of good salary and other incentives. My wish is to see such people do what they love, with quality facilities. I hope the Indian government invests more money into the higher education sector.</p>
          
          <p><b>4. Why don’t we do more for our farmers?</b></p>
          
          <p>Despite what all your government has done so far, majority of the farmers still have terrible conditions to deal with. Some simply cannot bear it and commit suicide. My main issue is some politicians use the lack of taxation in agriculture to park their money in this sector, while the majority of the farmers are left hanging dry. I may be naive in saying this, but there should be tax on agriculture at a ceiling such that those who deserve it can reap the rewards, while those who are in it for saving money are forced to pay.</p>
          
          <p>Such people do not understand India’s sociocultural ethos. Agriculture is the lifeline of India. It is the bedrock of our society and family system. It isn’t just any other business or profession- Virendra Singh, BJP Farmers Cell.</p>
          
          <p>And how do we view it in general? They are an afterthought to many in reality, lets be honest.<p>
          
          <p><b>5. When will sportsmen and artistes be given their due?</b></p>
          
          <p>I am of the opinion that we should support all sportspeople, musicians, dancers and artists as they make the nation proud by representing the ethos, culture and the winning spirit of India, either at the national or at the international level. Once we develop a culture where parents allow their children to do these activites and them not having to worry about their future, we will win Olympic medals and we will see Indians shine on the world stage and make us proud. Rather than just give the likes of Sindhu 50 lakhs after she did all the hard work, we can give medical and financial aid to the upcoming Sindhus of the various sports and other fields. And give them good quality competition and facilities to hone their talent.</p>
          
          <p><b>6. Will we ever make a step towards a meritocracy?</b></p>
          
          <p>I have no problems with the reservation system personally. I know a couple of people from poor background whose lives will change because the system gave them a chance to rise from their background and get good quality education to give their future generations a good circumstance to live. But we also know many cases, especially here on Quora where many genuine cases have been denied an opportunity from the general sector due to this system. As you propose a Uniform Civil Code apparently, will we see any change in this situation and stop doling out seats for each and every caste/religion. Or will political compulsions make sure you maintain the status quo? (Kind of like the Nash Equilibrium at this moment).</p>
          
          <p><b>7. Why do we encourage people like Ram Rahim??</b></p>
          
          <p>Self styled godmen have always been there throughout history across religions. But here they have political power. Your Haryana CM has used the influence of this Ram Rahim person, and stayed in power because of the lakhs of people ‘hypnotised’ by his acts. He ain’t the only one, yet I will only mention him because of the chaos in North India recently. It is true that you politician folks rather than break up this force by exposing their fraudulent activities, you use their base to win seats. I say this because Amit Shah and respected PM also know when to do what to win maximum votes. We can only stop them if there is a political will to weed them out, which is absent.</p>
          
          <p><b>8. How is nationalism and patriotism now linked with your political party?</b></p>
          
          <p>We have seen many Indians told to go to Pakistan, simply because they feel your policies and ideas aren’t as good. We have reached that stage where now if you don’t agree with the PM, we are not for India or something. And some journalists particularly an A GOSWAMI (capitals for loudness) also propagate that idea. Why do we need to shout down dissent? Democracy is about checks and balances. Why cannot we understand that they can raise issues. Some may be trivial. But they might just find a point which your government needs to work on. So why shut them down? Just so your party can win a few more seats? You guys have a majority in LS anyway. Its better than the UPA had to deal with.</p>
          
          <p><b>9. The status reports of your pet projects? Will we see tangible progress soon?</b></p>

          <p>Smart Cities. Ganga cleaning. Swaach Bharat and so on. We have seen many ideas which on paper are great. But let’s be honest, they are more paper than that of reality. The housing project in which by 2022 all Indians will have a house or something to that effect? Do show the citizens of India where we will reach with these projects because if implemented they can propel India to new heights.</p>
          
          <p><b>10. Will your party do its part by not taking part in political polarization and influencing people on social media?</b></p>
          
          <p>Some say life is a matter of perception. But it is not deniable that your party members have proven adequate at changing facts and perceptions to present your party in a better light(IT Cell alert). Fake news through Whats app and biased news representation all that has made me lose faith in the mainstream media and some alternative sites provide more real news than them. I would like to hope you guys, being the best at this business, to pipe down on that. Come on, we dont see anyone challenging your party for the 2019 elections. So why not go ahead and do some good governance than consolidate political position??</p>
