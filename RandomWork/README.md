# UdemyWebsiteWork

This work is intended to showcase my growth and workings as I make an introduction to most of web development using the Udemy Course on Web Development 2.0 . I also make references from my Web Development reference books and other material I look like up online so in the initial stages the pages I design will appear messy. But as I learn more I want to show how much of a learner I am.
